module Mutineer
  # Fork-based isolation for running one mutant. The block runs in a child
  # process; the parent enforces a wall-clock timeout and decodes the child's
  # exit status into a Result.
  #
  # Exit-status contract (the block's return value, or an explicit exit, is the
  # child's status): 0 => survived, 1 => killed, 2 => error. Timeout is
  # detected by the parent's monitor flag, not by status.signaled? (which is
  # true for ANY signal death, e.g. SIGSEGV — it cannot tell our SIGKILL apart
  # from the OS's).
  #
  # mutineer: the reload strategy this enables (whole-file `load`) re-executes
  # the entire file — any top-level code runs again. Acceptable for POROs;
  # document if users hit issues with initializers/callbacks. Alternative: the
  # redefine strategy (surgical single-method redefinition).

    # Runs the block in a forked child. The block's return value (an Integer
    # exit code) or any explicit `exit` is honoured; an unhandled exception
    # becomes exit 2 with the cause written to STDERR, and the cause also
    # becomes the error Result's details (see {ChildError}).
    #
    # The child silences its stdout (see {ChildStdout.silence}) before the
    # block runs, so test output never reaches the user. Stderr stays open.
    #
    # With `channel: true` (a `--matrix` run) the block gets the write end of a
    # pipe for {KillChannel} lines. The parent reads it while it waits, so a
    # child with more than a pipe buffer to say never blocks, and attaches the
