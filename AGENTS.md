# AGENTS.md — working on the mutineer gem

Conventions for any agent or contributor changing this repo. (Usage docs for
*consumers* live in `README.md` and `docs/`; this file is about developing the gem.)

## Non-negotiables

- **Zero runtime dependencies — Prism + stdlib only.** Never add a runtime gem.
  Dev-only deps (minitest, rake, yard) are fine. Ruby **≥ 3.4** (Prism ships with it).
- **No `eval`.** Removed in 0.6.1 (supply-chain scanner flag). The redefine strategy
  `load`s a tempfile snippet instead — don't reintroduce `eval`.
- **Least astonishment.** Names match behaviour, no hidden side effects, explicit
  failures over silent ones. Match the surrounding code's idiom.

## Before every commit (local gate)

```sh
bundle exec rake test                          # zero-dep suite
ruby -Ilib -e 'require "mutineer"'             # load smoke
bundle exec rake yard:strict                    # 100% documented — see below
```

The default `Gemfile` pins Minitest 5. For changes to the Minitest
integration, also run the suite on Minitest 6:

```sh
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/minitest6.gemfile bundle install
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/minitest6.gemfile bundle exec rake test
```

- **`yard:strict` requires 100% documentation, including private methods AND
  constants.** Every new method and constant needs a YARD docstring / `#` comment
  or CI fails.
- **Rails-dependent tests run via `bundle exec rake test:daemon`**, never the
  zero-dep default. The gem's own suite stays Rails-free; `test/fixtures/rails_app`
  has its OWN bundle. `rake test:daemon` runs in the rails-integration CI job.
- Subprocesses use plain `bundle exec` — never hardcode `rbenv exec` (breaks CI and
  non-rbenv users).

## Website checks

For changes to the GitHub Pages site or its tests, also run:

```sh
bundle exec rake site:build
node --test test/site_test.js
npm ci --prefix test/browser
npx --prefix test/browser playwright install chromium
npm test --prefix test/browser
```

`rake site:build` writes the published tree to `_site/` — the YARD API docs,
`sitemap.xml`, `llms-full.txt`, and `json-schema.html` are build artifacts, not
committed files under `docs/`. The checks above read `_site/`, so build first.

These development-only checks require Node.js 22+, npm, and Python 3.
Playwright starts a local server on port 8766; keep that port free so the
checks run against this checkout. The gem and its default Rake suite remain
independent of Node and Playwright. CI runs these checks in `website browser tests`.

## CI gates that block merge

`yard:strict` · `test` (×2 OS) · `test (minitest 6)` · `rails dogfood` + daemon integration · `website browser tests` · socket/gitguardian.

## PR review gate (before any merge — never skip)

Applies to **every** open PR (including stacks). Do not merge and do not
suggest merge until this is done on the current head.

### Before opening a new PR

Run `/dt-ship-pre-pr-gate` on the exact PR-head commit:

1. `/ce-code-review` — fix findings  
2. `/ie-review` — fix findings  
3. `/cubic-loop` (local) — fix findings  

Then `gh pr create`. A gate run is stale after any later commit; re-run.

### After the PR is open

1. **Re-review the PR** with the same three lenses (CE, IE, cubic PR/local
   mode). Fix real findings; commit and push.
2. **Address every review comment/thread** (cubic, bots, humans):
   - Fix or document why not
   - **Reply inline on every thread** (fix + commit SHA, or rationale)
   - Never resolve silently
3. **CI green** on the head SHA
4. Readiness skills only after 1–3: `check-pr-comments`,
   `dt-ship-pr-readiness`. Human merges.

**Stacked PRs:** gate each PR from the bottom of the stack up. After fixing
a lower PR, restack dependents and re-gate them.

## Releasing (tag-driven — CI publishes, no manual `gem push`)

Semver: **new feature → minor bump, fix → patch.** A behavior change to the
GitHub Action's defaults is a **major** bump: consumers pin `@v<major>`, and a
default flip must never reach them without opting in.

1. On a branch, bump `lib/mutineer/version.rb` and move the `CHANGELOG.md`
   `## [Unreleased]` block into a dated `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section.
2. Merge to `main`.
3. Tag and push — this is the whole release trigger:
   ```sh
   git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```
4. `.github/workflows/release.yml` then: guards `tag == Mutineer::VERSION`, runs
   tests, publishes to RubyGems via **Trusted Publishing** (OIDC — no API key, no
   OTP), cuts the GitHub release from the CHANGELOG section, and force-moves the
   floating major tag (`v1`, `v2`, …) to the release so `uses: …@v<major>`
   consumers track the latest in that line.

Safety nets:
- The **tag must equal `Mutineer::VERSION`** or the release aborts.
- **Releases are batched, not cut per merge.** `.github/workflows/release-pr.yml` runs
  weekly (Monday 08:00 UTC) and on demand (`gh workflow run release-pr.yml`). When
  `feat:`/`fix:` commits sit on `main` past the latest tag, it opens a release PR (bumps
  `version.rb`, dates the CHANGELOG + adds its reference-link def). Each run rebuilds that
  PR from the current `main`, so it always covers every change since the last tag; a
  newer version supersedes an older open release PR, and when `main` moved the same
  version is re-opened fresh (the old branch is deleted under a lease, never
  force-pushed). The run never replaces a release branch that holds someone else's
  commits, or that has a PR it did not open (it leaves that branch alone with a
  warning), and it never closes a release PR it did not open. A merge commit counts as
  someone else's commit: GitHub's "Update branch" button on the release PR pauses the
  automation until that PR is merged or its branch is deleted. Review + merge it, then push the
  `vX.Y.Z` tag. Every release moves the floating major tag (`v1` today), so Action users get it at once:
  batch changes rather than releasing after each merge. (To get CI on that auto-PR, add a
  `RELEASE_PR_TOKEN` PAT secret — a PR opened by the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` doesn't
  trigger other workflows.)
- **The release-PR run stops (and opens nothing) in two cases.** If `VERSION` on `main`
  differs from the latest tag, a bump is merged but not tagged: it warns you to push
  that tag first. If the computed `vX.Y.Z` tag already exists on origin (for example
  pushed from a branch), it fails and you resolve it by hand.
- **GitHub disables scheduled workflows in a public repo after 60 days without
  activity.** If no release PR appears on a Monday while unreleased `feat:`/`fix:`
  work sits on `main`, check `gh workflow view release-pr.yml` and re-enable it with
  `gh workflow enable release-pr.yml`.

**One-time setup (required for the publish to work):** register a Trusted Publisher
on <https://rubygems.org/gems/mutineer> → owner `davidteren`, repo `mutineer`,
workflow `release.yml`, no environment. Without it, `release.yml`'s `gem push` fails.

## Score-model discipline (don't regress this)

`score = killed / (killed + survived)`. `no_coverage`, `uncapturable`, `ignored`,
`skipped`, `errored` are ALL excluded from the denominator. Empty denominator → `nil`,
never `0.0`. The exact-survivor integration oracle must stay green.

## Repo mechanics

- `docs/plans/` is gitignored by a global rule — plan docs need `git add -f`.
- A git hook auto-branches commits made directly on `main`; commit on a feature branch.
