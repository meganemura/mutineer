module Mutineer
  # Daemon execution backend. Boots the app ONCE in a persistent subprocess under
  # the app's own bundle and forks per mutant, so a Rails run pays the boot cost
  # once instead of per mutant. Tool-side this only discovers jobs and builds the
  # ready-to-`load` payload (Prism); the daemon needs no Prism/mutineer.
  #
  # When jobs > 1 each worker runs against its OWN database, which is what makes
  # `--jobs N` safe under Rails (#26): parallel verdicts are identical to serial.
  # SQLite gets a per-fork file from the daemon. Any other adapter follows the
  # parallel_tests convention: every daemon is spawned with `TEST_ENV_NUMBER`
  # ({worker_env}), the app's database.yml turns it into a per-worker database
  # name, and {assert_distinct_databases!} stops the run when two workers still
  # share one. Creating one database per worker is the app's job (`rake parallel:setup`).
  #
  # Job collection, `--since` filtering and coverage selection stay on {Runner} and
  # are called from here, so the daemon path can never drift from the in-process
  # path on which mutants run or which tests narrow a mutant (score parity).
  #
  # Unlike {ExternalBackend}, which is a leaf {Runner} calls into, this module owns
  # its orchestration and calls back for that shared vocabulary.
  module DaemonBackend
    # Default per-mutant timeout on the daemon path (seconds), overridden by
    # config.daemon_timeout. Coverage narrowing usually keeps each job short; this
    # still covers a slow suite or full-suite fallback when the map is unavailable.

    # {ExternalBackend::SMOKE_TIMEOUT}, which bounds a different thing.
