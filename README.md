A clean-room mutation-testing tool for Ruby. Mutineer mutates your source one
change at a time, runs your test suite (Minitest or RSpec) against each mutant, and reports the
ones your tests failed to catch — the gaps where your suite isn't actually
testing anything.

- **Prism + stdlib only** — zero runtime dependencies (Ruby ≥ 3.4).
- **One mutation per mutant**, validity-checked by re-parsing.
- **Fork-isolated**, parallel execution (Linux + macOS).
- **Coverage-guided** — each mutant runs only the test files that cover its line.
- **Stops at the first failing test** — in-process runs (not `--daemon` or
  `--test-command`) stop a mutant's test run at the first failure.

📖 **[mutineer.github.io →](https://davidteren.github.io/mutineer/)** — overview, operators, and usage.

## Install

```sh
gem install mutineer
```

Or in a Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "mutineer", group: :test
```

## Usage

```sh
mutineer run <source...> --test <test...> [options]
```

Mutate `lib/calculator.rb`, checking it against its test, and fail CI if the
mutation score drops below 90%:

```sh
mutineer run lib/calculator.rb --test test/calculator_test.rb --threshold 90
```

### Options

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--test FILE` | Test file covering the sources (repeatable) |
| `--operators LIST` | Comma-separated operator names (default: the Tier-1 set) |
| `--threshold FLOAT` | Exit 1 when the score is below FLOAT, or when nothing could be scored and something broke, or more than one mutant produced no verdict and they exceed 10% of those attempted (default: 0 = off) |
| `--only NAME` | Restrict to one fully-qualified subject, e.g. `Calculator#add` |
| `--framework NAME` | `minitest` (default) or `rspec`; auto-detected as rspec when most `--test` files end in `_spec.rb` |
| `--since REF` | Only mutate lines changed since git `REF` (e.g. `origin/main`) — ideal for PR CI |
| `--no-since` | Disable diff scoping; a typed no beats a `.mutineer.yml` `since:` key |
| `--baseline FILE` | Compare against a prior `--format json` run; exit 1 on new survivors / score drop (score drop is skipped under `--since`, whose score covers a different denominator; see [CI](#ci-gating)) |
| `--baseline-epsilon FLOAT` | Score-drop tolerance for `--baseline` (default: 0) |
| `--jobs N` | Parallel worker count (default: processor count; `1` under `--rails`) |
| `--verbose` | Surface the real error when a fork capture fails (alias `--debug`) |
| `--strategy NAME` | Mutation application: `reload` whole-file (default) or `redefine` surgical (`7a`/`7b` accepted as deprecated aliases) |
| `--test-command CMD` | Run the suite as a subprocess in the app's own runtime (for apps on Ruby < 3.4); `CMD` must contain `%{files}`. See [Apps on Ruby < 3.4](#apps-on-ruby--34) |
| `--daemon` | Boot the app once in a persistent daemon and fork per mutant, with per-worker DB isolation so `--jobs N` is safe under Rails (needs `--rails`/`--boot`; not with `--test-command`). See [the daemon backend](#faster-parallel-safe-rails-the---daemon-backend) |
| `--format human\|json\|html` | Report format (default: human; `html` is a self-contained file) |
| `--output FILE` | Write the report to FILE instead of stdout |
| `--dry-run` | List candidate mutations without executing (honors suppression) |
| `--fail-fast` | Stop at the first surviving mutant |
| `--list-operators` | List available operators (default vs optional) and exit |
| `--version`, `--help` | Print version / usage and exit |

### Exit codes

<!-- contract:exit-codes -->
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Score ≥ threshold (or no gate) **and** no baseline regression. |
| `1` | Score below `--threshold`, OR nothing could be scored and something broke, or more than one mutant produced no verdict and they exceed 10% of those attempted, OR a `--baseline` regression, OR a runtime error. |
| `2` | Usage / invalid-flag error (mistyped flag, bad path, unreadable baseline). |
<!-- /contract:exit-codes -->

### Operators

Run `mutineer --list-operators` to see them. Default (Tier 1): `arithmetic`,
`comparison`, `boolean_connector`, `boolean_literal`, `statement_removal`.
Available but off by default (Tier 2, enable via `--operators`): `return_nil`,
`literal_mutation`, `condition_negation`, `string_literal`, `regex`,
`collection_method`, `safe_navigation`, `range`, `negation_removal`, `chain_link`,
`operand_removal`, `array_literal`.

## Rails apps

Rails code needs its environment booted before the suite runs, so point Mutineer
at your app with `--rails` and run it inside the project's bundle:

```sh
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec mutineer run \
  app/models/order.rb --test test/models/order_test.rb --rails
```

`--rails` boots `config/environment` once in the parent process (every mutant
then forks and inherits it), defaults `--strategy` to `redefine` (surgical — it
avoids reloading files into the app tree), and reconnects ActiveRecord in each
fork so the database connection is fork-safe. Use `--boot FILE` to boot a
different entry point. Boot mode requires at least one `--test` file and is
coverage-guided — each mutant runs only the test files that exercise its line
(coverage is captured by forking the booted app, then cached).

Add Mutineer to your Gemfile's test group:

```ruby
gem "mutineer", group: :test, require: false
```

### Faster, parallel-safe Rails (the `--daemon` backend)

`--rails` boots your app once but runs mutants **serially** — parallel `--jobs`
under Rails is unsafe, because every worker shares one test database and clobbers
the others' fixtures. `--daemon` fixes both: it boots the app once in a persistent
helper and forks per mutant, and gives **each parallel worker its own database**,
so `--jobs N` is safe and its verdicts are proven identical to a serial run.

```sh
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec mutineer run \
  app/models/order.rb --test test/models/order_test.rb \
  --rails --daemon --jobs 4
```

- **One boot, forked per mutant** — restores the shared-boot speed.
- **Coverage-guided** — each mutant runs only its covering tests (like `--rails`);
  a mutant on an uncovered line is `no_coverage`, so the score stays comparable to
  the in-process `--rails` score.
- **Safe `--jobs N`** — each worker uses its own test database, so parallel verdicts
  equal serial (no fixture cross-talk). SQLite is routed for you; other databases
  follow the `parallel_tests` convention (below).
- **One backend at a time** — `--daemon` can't be combined with `--test-command`
  (choose one), and it needs an app to boot (`--rails` or `--boot`).

#### SQLite

Nothing to set up. Each worker gets its own database file next to the test one
(`storage/test-1.sqlite3`, and so on) and loads `db/schema.rb` into it.

#### PostgreSQL and other databases

Mutineer uses the `parallel_tests` convention. For every `--daemon` run it sets
`TEST_ENV_NUMBER` and `PARALLEL_TEST_GROUPS` (the worker count) itself, and
each worker's daemon gets its own `TEST_ENV_NUMBER`: empty for worker 0, then
`2`, `3`, and so on. A value already set in your shell is overridden. This is
the numbering that `parallel_tests` uses. Other tools that read the same
variable may start from a different number. Put the number in the database
name:

```yaml
# config/database.yml
test:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: myapp_test<%= ENV["TEST_ENV_NUMBER"] %>
```

Create one database per worker: `myapp_test`, `myapp_test2`, ...
`myapp_testN`. `--jobs` defaults to the number of CPUs, so either run
`rake parallel:setup` (it creates one per CPU, the same default) or pass
`--jobs N` and create N databases:

```sh
bundle exec rake parallel:setup      # or, per worker:
RAILS_ENV=test TEST_ENV_NUMBER=2 bin/rails db:create db:schema:load
```

Mutineer does not create databases or load the schema for these adapters. If a
daemon cannot connect, for example because worker 3 has no database, the run
stops before the first mutant and names the missing database. If two workers
resolve to the same database, it stops too, with the `database.yml` line to
add. Plain `--rails` (no `--daemon`) does not set `TEST_ENV_NUMBER`, so it uses
whatever your shell provides: normally unset, that is `myapp_test`.

The number counts workers on one machine. If you also split a CI job across
nodes and the nodes share one database server, add the node index to the
database name yourself, for example with `CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX` or
`CI_NODE_INDEX`.

On macOS, a forked child that connects to PostgreSQL crashes once its parent has
connected, because libpq initialises its GSS code once per process. Mutineer does
not work around this. Export `PGGSSENCMODE=disable` before you run it, with or
without `--daemon`.

### Apps on Ruby < 3.4

Mutineer's own process needs Ruby ≥ 3.4 (it parses with stdlib Prism), and the
`--rails` path above boots your app *inside Mutineer's process* — so it can't run
against an app pinned to an older Ruby (`ruby "3.1.6"` in the Gemfile), where the
bundle rejects 3.4.

`--test-command` decouples the two: Mutineer stays on ≥ 3.4, but your suite runs
as a **subprocess in your app's own runtime** (whatever Ruby its bundle resolves
to). Run Mutineer with a 3.4+ Ruby and hand it the command that runs your tests:

```sh
RAILS_ENV=test mutineer run app/models/order.rb \
  --test test/models/order_test.rb \
  --test-command "bundle exec rails test %{files}"
```

- **`%{files}`** is required; it expands to the `--test` paths as separate
  arguments (a path with a space stays one argument — there is no shell).
- **Environment:** vars like `RAILS_ENV` / `DATABASE_URL` set on the Mutineer
  command are inherited. Mutineer **unsets** `BUNDLE_*`, `GEM_*`, `RUBY*`,
  `RBENV_VERSION`, `ASDF_RUBY_VERSION`, and `RBENV_DIR` in the child (so
  Mutineer's own Ruby cannot pin the suite), and drops version-manager
  **version bins** (e.g. `~/.rbenv/versions/3.4.x/bin`) from `PATH`, then
  prepends rbenv/asdf shims when a pin was scrubbed. Do not rely on
  `RBENV_VERSION=…` on the Mutineer command for the suite; use `.ruby-version`
  or a wrapper. Don't put `KEY=val` prefixes *inside* `--test-command` (no shell;
  that would be treated as the program name).

#### Under a version manager (rbenv / asdf / chruby)

Automatic scrub targets **rbenv** and **asdf** (shims + version bins). **chruby**
has no shims: Mutineer still strips `…/rubies/…/bin` so it cannot leave Mutineer's
Ruby pinned, but you need a wrapper that sources chruby and selects the app
version. If the smoke check still reports a **Ruby version mismatch**, wrap the
suite. Example rbenv wrapper (`bin/mutineer-test` in the app):

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."
unset GEM_HOME GEM_PATH RUBYLIB RUBYOPT BUNDLE_GEMFILE BUNDLE_BIN_PATH BUNDLER_VERSION
export RBENV_VERSION="$(cat .ruby-version 2>/dev/null || true)"
export RAILS_ENV="${RAILS_ENV:-test}"
export PATH="${HOME}/.rbenv/shims:${PATH}"
exec bundle exec rails test "$@"
```

```sh
# Mutineer on 3.4+; suite on the app's Ruby via the wrapper
mutineer run app/models/order.rb \
  --test test/models/order_test.rb \
  --test-command "bin/mutineer-test %{files}"
```

Mutineer also surfaces a targeted smoke-check message when Bundler prints
`RubyVersionMismatch`, instead of only blaming DB/migrations.

Tradeoffs — this path is correct but not free:

- **Slower:** your app re-boots for every mutant (no shared boot yet).
- **No coverage narrowing:** every mutant runs the *full* `--test` set, so the
  score is an **upper bound and not comparable to an in-process (`--rails`)
  score** — uncovered mutants count as survivors, and an infrastructure failure
  is scored as a kill. Mutineer prints this caveat on every run and aborts up
  front (a "smoke check") if your unmutated suite isn't green.
- **Reload strategy only** (`--strategy redefine` is rejected on this path) and
  **serial** (`--jobs` is forced to 1). For apps on Ruby ≥ 3.4, `--daemon` gives
  safe parallelism instead (see [the daemon backend](#faster-parallel-safe-rails-the---daemon-backend)).

## Suppressing equivalent mutants

Some mutants are equivalent (behaviour-identical) and survive forever — keeping a
file off 100%. Suppress them so the score and `--threshold` gate stay meaningful:

- **Inline:** `some_line # mutineer:disable-line` (or scope it: `# mutineer:disable-line comparison`). Put a reason after `--`: `# mutineer:disable-line comparison -- the test checks only 20`.
- **Config:** a `.mutineer.yml` `ignore:` list of mutant ids. Each survivor's
  `id` is printed in the JSON report, so copy it straight into `ignore:`.

Suppressed mutants are excluded from the score (so 100% becomes reachable).

## Mutant ids

A mutant id is 12 hex characters. It hashes the file path (relative to the
project root), the method's qualified name, the operator, the mutated code, and
the mutant's position among identical mutants in that method. When one file has
two methods with the same qualified name (for example two top-level `def index`
in two DSL blocks), the second and later ones also hash their position among
those methods, so their ids differ. The first one's id does not change. An edit
outside the method does not change the id. Moving or renaming the file,
renaming the method or its class, or adding an identical mutant earlier in the
method does. Adding a method with the same name earlier in the same file also
does.

- The project root is the directory mutineer runs from (in the Action, the
  `working-directory`). Run from the same root to get the same ids.
- A source outside the project root uses its absolute path, so its ids differ
  between machines.

**Migrating from ids without the file path.** Before 1.3, ids did not include
the file path, so two files could share an id (#126). Old-format ids keep
working until 2.0, with a warning:

- **`ignore:`** An old entry still suppresses its mutants. The run prints the
  new ids for each old entry, each with its file and method. When it names one
  mutant, replace the entry with that id. When it names several (in different
  files, or same-named methods in one file), the old entry over-matched: it also
  hid mutants you did not mean to ignore. The warning says so. Keep only the ids for the mutant you meant to
  ignore, not all of them. The list covers only the sources and operators in
  that run, so run over every source with every operator set you use (for
  example your Tier-2 `--operators`) for the full list.
- **`--baseline`** An old baseline still matches: a survivor matches a stored
  one with the same old id in the same file. A stored file that is an absolute
  path outside the project root (a baseline written on another machine)
  matches on the old id alone. The run tells you to
  regenerate it. Regenerate it with `--format json`, but only after every gate
  that reads it runs 1.3 or later (the Action's `version:` pin, your CI
  `Gemfile.lock`). An older version treats every new-format survivor as new.

The JSON report's `summary.id_format` is `2` for the new format.
`summary.legacy_id_matches.ignore` counts the old-format ignore entries a run
matched, and `summary.legacy_id_matches.baseline` counts the survivors matched
only through an old baseline id.

Ids are relative to the directory you run mutineer from. mutineer finds
`.mutineer.yml` by walking up. When the file it loads is in a parent directory
(other than your home directory), it warns that the ignore ids will not match
and tells you which directory to run from.

## CI gating

Store a JSON run as a baseline, then fail the build only when a PR makes things
worse:

```sh
mutineer run app/ --baseline .mutineer/baseline.json   # exit 1 on NEW survivors or a score drop
```

`--baseline` reports which survivors are new (by [mutant id](#mutant-ids)) and any score drop. It
combines with `--threshold` (the worse of the two sets the exit code). Pass a
directory (or several sources) to audit a whole layer in one boot — tests are
auto-paired by convention and the report breaks down per source.

### GitHub Action

This repo ships a composite action (`action.yml`) that wraps the CLI for CI:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
  with: { ruby-version: "3.4", bundler-cache: true }
- uses: davidteren/mutineer@v1
  with:
    sources: app/
    baseline: .mutineer/baseline.json
    threshold: "90"
```

**Default change:** on `pull_request` events (not `pull_request_target`) the
action scopes the run to the PR's changed lines, diffing against the PR's exact
base commit (fetched by the action itself when the checkout is shallow; falls
back to the base branch tip). Pass `since: none` for a full scan, or an
explicit `since:` ref (which needs `fetch-depth: 0` on checkout).

With the default JSON format the action also:

- writes a score summary to the job's step summary;
- annotates surviving mutants on the PR diff, up to 50 (`error` level when the
  gate failed, `warning` when it passed);
- exposes the report path via the `report` output for later steps (with
  `format: human`/`html` this needs the `output` input).

The CLI prints a progress line to the log at every 10% of the run, whatever
the format.

## For AI agents & pipelines

Mutineer is built for programmatic use — versioned JSON, [mutant ids](#mutant-ids) that survive unrelated edits,
structured exit codes, and diff-scoped runs. See:

## Configuration

Mutineer reads an optional `.mutineer.yml` from the project root (nearest one,
walking up). CLI flags override config; config overrides defaults.

Sources are positional CLI arguments and test files come from `--test`; the
config file accepts these keys: `operators`, `threshold`, `jobs`, `only`,
`require` (extra files to load before mutating), `boot`/`rails`, and
`test_command` (the external-runtime suite command — see
[Apps on Ruby < 3.4](#apps-on-ruby--34)).

```yaml
# .mutineer.yml
operators: [arithmetic, comparison, boolean_connector, boolean_literal, statement_removal]
threshold: 90
jobs: 4
require:
  - config/environment
```

Coverage results are cached in `.mutineer/coverage.json` (digest-keyed; rebuilt
automatically when sources change). Add `.mutineer/` to your `.gitignore`.
