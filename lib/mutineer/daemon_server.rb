module Mutineer
  # App-side daemon (persistent worker).
  #
  # Runs UNDER THE APP'S OWN BUNDLE/RUBY (the tool's DaemonClient spawns it via
  # `bundle exec ruby`). It boots the app ONCE, then serves per-mutant test-run
  # requests over stdin/stdout as newline-delimited JSON. For each request it
  # FORKS a child that loads the mutated source text the tool sent, runs the
  # covering tests, and exits with a status the parent decodes into a verdict.
  #
  # HARD CONSTRAINT: this file must be loadable WITHOUT Prism or the rest of
  # mutineer. The app's Ruby may be < 3.4 (no stdlib Prism) and its bundle has no
  # mutineer. So it requires ONLY stdlib + the app's own boot file; it
  # re-implements the fork/timeout/decode loop rather than requiring
  # `isolation.rb` (which pulls in Prism). All parsing/mutation happened
  # tool-side; the daemon only `load`s text.
  #
  # Protocol (one JSON object per line, both directions):
  #   boot in  : {"cmd":"boot","project_root":"...","boot":"config/environment",
  #               "load_paths":["test"],"framework":"minitest","rails":true,"schema":"db/schema.rb"}
  #   ready out: {"ready":true,"ruby":"3.3.6","database":"app_test2"}
  #              (or {"ready":false,"error":"..."} then exit). "database" is the
  #              connected database for a non-SQLite Rails app, else null.
  #   run  in  : {"id":N,"worker":I,"payload":{"code":"<ruby>","source_file":"app/models/order.rb"},
  #               "tests":["test/models/order_test.rb"],"timeout":30}
  #   verdict  : {"id":N,"verdict":"survived"|"killed"|"error"|"timeout"}
  #   quit in  : {"cmd":"quit"}
  #
  # Worker isolation: when the app is Rails on SQLite, each fork is routed to its
  # own database `<db>-<worker>` via {RailsWorkerDb} BEFORE any test loads, so
  # concurrent workers cannot clobber each other's transactional fixtures.
  # `worker` defaults to 0 (serial). Any other adapter is not routed here: each
  # daemon process resolves its own database from database.yml under the
  # `TEST_ENV_NUMBER` its client set, and boot fails fast if that database is
  # unreachable.
  #
  # Verdict mapping: child exit 0=survived (suite passed), 1=killed (suite
  # failed), 2=error (child raised AROUND the test: load, boot, or worker-DB
  # routing failure); parent-detected timeout. Tagging an in-test DB error (one
  # fired inside a test body, vs at routing time) as `error` rather than
  # `killed` is only observable under the concurrent gate and is not yet
  # implemented.
